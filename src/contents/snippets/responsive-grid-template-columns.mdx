## Short Intro

Let's say you want to recreate the layout above. In order to do that, we can use CSS's `grid-template-columns` property
and `repeat()` function.

The `repeat()` function allows you to repeat columns as many times as needed. In this below code, `repeat(3)` will
create a 3-columns grid, with `1fr` meaning to let the columns take 100% of the available space.

<Copy />

```css
.grid {
	display: grid;

	/* define the number of grid columns */
	grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

## How to achieve the layout above

Instead of using `repeat(3)`, we can use `repeat(auto-fit, ...)` so that it will resize according to the second
parameter of the `repeat()` method. In the code below, `minmax(300px, 1fr)` will allow the columns to take a minimum
width of `300px` and a maximum width of `1fr` (which is 100% of the available space).

<Copy />

```css
.card-wrapper {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
}
```

Just like that, now we only need to add the `.card-wrapper` class into our HTML element, like so:

<Copy />

```HTML
<div className='card-wrapper ...'>...</div>
```
