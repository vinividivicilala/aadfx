  Today, let’s learn how easy Zustand can make it to manage global client-side state in React by making a to-do list
  with it.

When I first came across Zustand, I couldn’t believe how easy it was to use. The learning curve is incredibly thin. If
you are familiar with how immutable state works in React, then you will feel right at home working with Zustand. So,
without further ado, let’s make ourselves a to-do list.

## Step 1: Install these packages

<Copy />

```bash
yarn add zustand @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons uuid
yarn add @types/uuid --save-dev
```

## Step 2: Creating our Todo Store

### a. Initialize Todo Model

First, before introducing Zustand, we will create a model for our to-do list to describe what the data structure of each
to-do will look like. Open the Todo.ts file and put the following code into it.

<Copy />

```typescript
// Todo.ts
export interface Todo {
	id: string;
	description: string;
	completed: boolean;
}
```

### b. Create Zustand Store

We will now be creating the state management logic for our to-do app. This is where Zustand comes into play.

<Copy />

```typescript
//todoStore.ts
import create from "zustand";
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

import { Todo } from "./model/Todo";

interface TodoState {
	todos: Todo[];
	addTodo: (description: string) => void;
	removeTodo: (id: string) => void;
	toggleCompletedState: (id: string) => void;
}

export const useStore = create<TodoState>((set) => ({
	// initial state
	todos: [],
	// methods for manipulating state
	addTodo: (description: string) => {
		set((state) => ({
			todos: [
				...state.todos,
				{
					id: uuidv4(),
					description,
					completed: false,
				} as Todo,
			],
		}));
	},
	removeTodo: (id) => {
		set((state) => ({
			todos: state.todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id),
		}));
	},
	toggleCompletedState: (id) => {
		set((state) => ({
			todos: state.todos.map((todo) => (todo.id === id ? ({ ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } as Todo) : todo)),
		}));
	},
}));
```

## Using Zustand inside our React App

<Copy />

```js
const { addTodo, removeTodo, toggleCompletedState, todos } = useStore();
```

That's it!

## Wrapping Up

Zustand is perhaps the simplest and least boiler-plately state-management solution that I have yet to use in React. It’s
enjoyable to work with and doesn’t have a steep learning curve for those who already understand React.

As always, I’m open to any comments and feedback that you might have. Feel free to share your favorite React
state-management library. I’d love to hear.
